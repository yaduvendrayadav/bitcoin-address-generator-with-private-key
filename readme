# Bitcoin Address Generator

This script generates Bitcoin addresses based on a private key using the Bitcoin address generation algorithm. It supports both mainnet and testnet addresses, including legacy P2PKH addresses, P2WPKH-P2SH addresses, and native segwit P2WPKH addresses.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Dependencies: `base58`, `binascii`, `bitcoinaddress`, `hashlib`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bitcoin-address-generator.git

2. Install the dependencies:

   pip install base58 binascii bitcoinaddress hashlib

3. Run the script:
   python generate_addresses.py

   Enter the private key in hexadecimal format when prompted.
   The script will generate the Bitcoin addresses and display them on the console.

## Output

   The script generates the following Bitcoin addresses:

   Public Key: The uncompressed public key in hexadecimal format.
   Public Key Compressed: The compressed public key in hexadecimal format.
   Public Address 1: P2PKH address (uncompressed).
   Public Address 1 Compressed: P2PKH address (compressed).
   Public Address 3: P2WPKH-P2SH address (uncompressed).
   Public Address bc1 P2WPKH: Native segwit P2WPKH address.
